# C9Vector

A small set of types for working with vectors and planes in three-space.

A bit of a 'stretching exercise' after being away from java for a
couple of years. Add in some back-fill on quaternions that I hadn't
taken the time for before now and these could perhaps be useful.

This was spawned by some cancelled work that involved this sort of
manipulation and a desire to get a better understanding of the
advantages of quaternions for handling rotations.
